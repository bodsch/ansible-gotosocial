##### OIDC CONFIG #####
#######################

# Config for authentication with an external OIDC provider (Dex, Google, Auth0, etc).

# Bool. Enable authentication with external OIDC provider. If set to true, then
# the other OIDC options must be set as well. If this is set to false, then the standard
# internal oauth flow will be used, where users sign in to GtS with username/password.
# Options: [true, false]
# Default: false
oidc-enabled: false

# String. Name of the oidc idp (identity provider). This will be shown to users when
# they log in.
# Examples: ["Google", "Dex", "Auth0"]
# Default: ""
oidc-idp-name: ""

# Bool. Skip the normal verification flow of tokens returned from the OIDC provider, ie.,
# don't check the expiry or signature. This should only be used in debugging or testing,
# never ever in a production environment as it's extremely unsafe!
# Options: [true, false]
# Default: false
oidc-skip-verification: false

# String. The OIDC issuer URI. This is where GtS will redirect users to for login.
# Typically this will look like a standard web URL.
# Examples: ["https://auth.example.org", "https://example.org/auth"]
# Default: ""
oidc-issuer: ""

# String. The ID for this client as registered with the OIDC provider.
# Examples: ["some-client-id", "fda3772a-ad35-41c9-9a59-f1943ad18f54"]
# Default: ""
oidc-client-id: ""

# String. The secret for this client as registered with the OIDC provider.
# Examples: ["super-secret-business", "79379cf5-8057-426d-bb83-af504d98a7b0"]
# Default: ""
oidc-client-secret: ""

# Array of string. Scopes to request from the OIDC provider. The returned values will be used to
# populate users created in GtS as a result of the authentication flow. 'openid' and 'email' are required.
# 'profile' is used to extract a username for the newly created user.
# 'groups' is optional and can be used to determine if a user is an admin (if they're in the group 'admin' or 'admins').
# Examples: See eg., https://auth0.com/docs/scopes/openid-connect-scopes
# Default: ["openid", "email", "profile", "groups"]
oidc-scopes:
  - "openid"
  - "email"
  - "profile"
  - "groups"
